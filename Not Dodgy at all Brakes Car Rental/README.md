# Not Dodgy at all Brakes Car Rental

Front end challenge

# Instructions
please clone or download and open index.html

## Requirements:

Your task is to create the Web Application for ‘Dodgy Brakes Car Rental’.  The index.html page will have a ‘header’ and ‘footer’ that will display a company logo and the current date and time. Include a suitable background photo for the page and a link to ‘rental.html’.

The ‘rental.html’ page, has the following functionality:

Your page will include a ‘search’ field and a ‘car rental’ form. The ‘car rental’ form will be un-editable until a client is found and selected.
 
The ‘search’ field will search ‘rentalclient.json’ by last name. As you enter letters, the search function will find and display all the clients whose last names start with those letters. 

Example: If you enter ‘B’, all the clients with a last name’ that starts with ‘B’ will be displayed. When you type ‘Br’ all the clients with a last name’ that starts with ‘Br’ are displayed.

NOTE: Only display the Last and First Names of the clients.

You can then select a client from the list. This ‘event’ will make the ‘car rental’ form editable.

After a client is selected, the client information will be displayed in the ‘car rental’ form. E.g. last name, first name, address, state/prov, email and phone.

The client can then choose to rent a vehicle. The rental choices are: 

Compact	$15/day
Mid-size	$20/day
Luxury		$35/day
Van/Truck	$40/day

Note: Include a picture of a vehicle next to each of the rental choices.

Options: Roof Rack or Bicycle Rack extra $5/day
	   GPS extra $10
	   Child Seat free

The client can rent from 1 to 30 days.

After this information is selected, the total of the rental is calculated and the complete client and rental information will be displayed on the page. This can appear on the page or in an ‘alert’ field.
