## Requirements:

Your application will work with the following types of currency:

Euro
US Dollar

Please research the most recent currency exchange rates.

This application will allow you to convert between any of these listed currencies. Your application will allow a user to select the type and amount of a currency on hand and select what currency to convert it to.

Example:

A user has 500 Euro and wants to convert this to Japanese Yen. They select ‘Euro’ from ‘Currency on hand’ and enter the amount. They select ‘Japanese Yen’ from ‘Covert to’ column. Your application will require a JavaScript event handler (eg onChange) that will respond when the user selects the type from the ‘Covert to’ column.

Currency on hand	Amount	Covert to:	Conversion Value
Euro	500	Japanese Yen	59872 Yen (119.74:1)

Your Conversion Value should display the converted amount to 2 significant digits, the type of currency and the conversion ratio.
