# Instructions
please clone or download and open index.html

## Requirements:

Use HTML 5, CSS and JavaScript to create a web application for ‘City Delicatessen’. This will take a customer order, calculate the cost and display the results on the page.


Page Requirements:

•	Textboxes for:  First and Last Name, Address and Phone number. 
•	The customer can chose to order any one Pizza, Sandwich or drink from the menu.
•	The Pizza choices are:
o	‘Super Cheesy’, ‘Extra Meaty’, ‘Really Veggy’ (Choose only one of these)
o	Sizes and prices are: Small: $8.50, Medium: $11.50, Large $14.00, Extra Large $16.50
o	Quantity (default is 0)
o	The customer can also add any or all of these extra toppings at $1.75 for each:
	Extra Cheese
	Pepperoni
	Mushrooms
	Bacon
	Olives

•	The Sandwich Choices are (Choose one only one of these):
o	All Garden Vegetarian $7.50
o	Big Beef on a Bun $8.50
o	Mixed Grill $9.50
o	Grilled Pork $9.50
o	Quantity (default is 0)
•	The drink choices are: 
o	Cola
o	Orange
o	Lemon
o	Root Beer
o	Sizes and prices are: Small: $1.25, Medium $1.75, Large: $2.00
o	Quantity (default is 0)

•	The web page will include the following features:
o	Include the current date at the top of the Page. Use ‘onLoad’ or ‘window.onload’ to create the ‘Date’ object and display it on the page
o	Include a background image or pattern.
o	Place a ‘thumbnail’ picture beside each type of pizza and sandwich.  When the user ‘hovers’ over the picture a larger picture of that item will be displayed. E.g. if the ‘thumbnail’ picture is 75 pixels, the larger picture will be up to 200 pixels.

Functionality:

Use HTML5 inputs and ‘patterns’ to ensure that the First and Last name only contain alphabetic, spaces and hyphens in the name. Create a pattern to validate the Phone Number. All these elements are required and will display an error if left blank.

Use CSS to manage the presentation of the page.

The text fields should NOT go blank when the page reloads after the ‘alert’ box is cleared.

Your web app will use a JavaScript function to calculate the total cost of the order and print to the screen the customer’s name, address, phone, the details of the order and the final cost.
