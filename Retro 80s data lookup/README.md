# Retro 80s data lookup

Front end challenge

## Requirements:

You are to create a web page that will search for an employee. You are to use the ‘dataset.xml’ file that contains ‘employee’ data. Your application will do the following:
	
-	You can search for an employee on these fields: ‘last_name’, ‘id’ and ‘job_title’.
-	Each of these search fields must be connected to a unique Event Listener that is set to call a function when the ‘keyup’ or ‘onkeyup’ event occurs. As data is typed into the search field, the search function will display all employee records that start with that search string.

-	Example: If you are searching by ‘last_name’ and you enter ‘B’, all the records with a last_name’ that starts with ‘B’ will be displayed. When you type ‘Br’ all the records with a last_name’ that starts with ‘Br’ are displayed.

-	Example: If you are searching by ‘id’ and you enter ‘2’ all the records with ‘id’ starting with ‘2’ will be displayed. If you enter ‘25’ all the records with ‘id’ starting with ‘25’ will be displayed.
